## 🔄 Real-Time Updates

The system doesn't use WebSockets, but updates happen:

1. **User creates** → Instantly visible in admin panel (after refresh/reopen)
2. **Admin approves/declines** → Instantly updates in admin UI
3. **User reopens popup** → Fetches latest status from database

For true real-time updates, consider adding:
- WebSocket integration
- Polling every N seconds
- Server-Sent Events (SSE)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Add appointment rescheduling
- Add notes field for admin
- Add appointment time slots
- Add appointment categories
