## Backend Integration Guide

### Required API Endpoints

#### 1. Get All Appointments (Admin)
```
GET /api/admin/appointments
Response: Array of appointments with user details
```

#### 2. Approve Appointment
```
PATCH /api/admin/appointments/:id/approve
Updates status to 'approved'
```

#### 3. Decline Appointment
```
PATCH /api/admin/appointments/:id/decline
Updates status to 'declined'
```

#### 4. Get User Appointment
```
GET /api/appointments/me
Returns current user's appointment
```

#### 5. Create Appointment
```
POST /api/appointments
Body: { date, time, reason }
Creates new appointment with user info from session
```

### Database Schema Suggestion

```prisma
model Appointment {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  date      String
  time      String
  reason    String
  status    AppointmentStatus @default(PENDING)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

enum AppointmentStatus {
  PENDING
  APPROVED
  DECLINED
}
```

### Integration Steps

1. **Create Prisma Model** (if using Prisma)
2. **Create API Routes** in `/api/appointments/` and `/api/admin/appointments/`
3. **Replace localStorage calls** with API calls:
   - In `AdminAppointmentsPopup.tsx`: Replace `loadAppointments()` with API fetch
   - In `AppointmentPopup.tsx`: Replace localStorage with API calls
4. **Add Authentication**: Ensure admin-only access to admin routes
5. **Add Real-time Updates**: Consider using WebSockets or polling

## Styling Consistency

The components maintain consistency with existing design:

## Security Considerations

When implementing backend:
- âœ… Validate admin permissions
- âœ… Sanitize user inputs
- âœ… Rate limit appointment creation
- âœ… Validate date/time formats
- âœ… Prevent duplicate appointments
- âœ… Add CSRF protection
