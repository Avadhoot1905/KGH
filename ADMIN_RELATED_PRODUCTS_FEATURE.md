# Related Products Admin UI Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a related products selector for the admin interface, allowing administrators to establish relationships between products when creating or editing them.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Schema & Database** ✅
- Schema already has `relatedProducts` and `relatedTo` fields in the Product model
- Many-to-many self-referential relationship via `_RelatedProducts` join table
- Migration applied successfully

### 2. **Backend Actions** (`src/actions/products.ts`)

#### New Function:
- `getAllProductsForSelector()` - Fetches all products (id, name) for the selector dropdown

#### Updated Functions:
- `createProductAction()` - Now accepts `relatedProductIds` from form data and connects products
- `updateProductAction()` - Now accepts `relatedProductIds` and uses `set` operation to update relationships
- `ProductListItem` type - Added `relatedProducts?: { id: string; name: string }[]`
- `baseInclude` - Now includes related products in queries

#### Implementation Details:
- Related product IDs are passed as a comma-separated string via form data
- Uses Prisma's `connect` for creating relationships
- Uses Prisma's `set` for updating relationships (replaces all existing)

### 3. **RelatedProductsSelector Component** (`src/app/components1/RelatedProductsSelector.tsx`)

#### Features:
- **Search functionality** - Filter products by name
- **Multi-select** - Check/uncheck products with checkboxes
- **Visual feedback** - Selected products shown as removable tags
- **Count indicator** - Shows number of selected products
- **Click-outside to close** - Dropdown closes when clicking outside
- **Dark mode support** - Matches existing UI theme
- **Filters current product** - Prevents selecting the product itself (for edit mode)

#### Props:
- `products` - Array of all available products
- `selectedIds` - Currently selected product IDs
- `onChange` - Callback to update selected IDs
- `currentProductId` (optional) - ID of current product being edited

#### UI:
- Search input field at top
- Selected products displayed as tags with × button to remove
- Dropdown with scrollable list of products
- Hidden input field for form submission (`name="relatedProductIds"`)

### 4. **AdminProductCard Component** (`src/app/components1/AdminProductCard.tsx`)

#### Updates:
- Added state for `allProducts`, `selectedRelatedIds`, `loadingProducts`
- Created `loadProducts()` function to fetch products when needed
- Created `openDialog()` function to initialize selector state
- Integrated RelatedProductsSelector in edit form
- Placed next to Category field for consistency
- Shows loading state while fetching products
- Pre-populates with existing related products

### 5. **AdminCreateProduct Component** (`src/app/components1/AdminCreateProduct.tsx`)

#### Updates:
- Added state for `allProducts`, `selectedRelatedIds`, `loadingProducts`
- Created `loadProducts()` function to fetch products
- Updated `openDialog()` function to load products and reset selection
- Integrated RelatedProductsSelector in create form
- Placed next to Category field for consistency
- Shows loading state while fetching products

## User Experience

## Technical Details

### Form Data Structure:
```
relatedProductIds: "id1,id2,id3"  // Comma-separated string
```

### Database Operations:
```typescript
// Create - connects specified products
relatedProducts: {
  connect: ids.map(id => ({ id }))
}

// Update - replaces all related products
relatedProducts: {
  set: ids.map(id => ({ id }))
}
```

### Product Queries:
All product list queries now include related products:
```typescript
include: {
  //...existing relations
  relatedProducts: { select: { id: true, name: true } }
}
```

## UI Placement
The Related Products selector is placed:
- **After Category field** in both Create and Edit forms
- **Spans 2 columns** (`md:col-span-2`) for more space
- **Same styling** as other form fields for consistency

## Security
- Only accessible to admin users (email: arcsmo19@gmail.com)
- Same authorization as other product management functions
- Product selector function checks admin permissions
