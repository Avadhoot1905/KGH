# üéØ Appointment System - Complete Integration Guide

## ‚úÖ INTEGRATION COMPLETE!

The appointment booking system is now **fully integrated** and working! The entire flow from user booking ‚Üí database ‚Üí admin approval ‚Üí user notification is functional.

---

## üîÑ How the System Works

### User Flow (End-to-End)

1. **User visits the website** (authenticated via Google OAuth)
2. **Clicks the red floating appointment button** (visible on all pages except /mod)
3. **Fills out the appointment form** with:
   - Date
   - Time
   - Reason for appointment
4. **Submits the appointment** ‚Üí Saved to database with status = `PENDING`
5. **Database immediately reflects** the new appointment
6. **User sees their appointment** in the popup with "Pending" status
7. **Admin views the appointment** on the `/mod` page
8. **Admin approves or declines** the appointment
9. **Database updates** the appointment status to `APPROVED` or `DECLINED`
10. **User refreshes and sees** the updated status in their appointment popup

### Admin Flow (End-to-End)

1. **Admin logs in** (must be `arcsmo19@gmail.com` or `ojasvikathuria777@gmail.com`)
2. **Navigates to `/mod` page**
3. **Clicks "View Appointments" button** (or Admin Appointments icon)
4. **Sees all appointments** with filters:
   - All
   - Pending (default)
   - Approved
   - Declined
5. **Clicks Approve ‚úì or Decline ‚úó** on any appointment
6. **Database immediately updates** the appointment status
7. **Appointment list updates** to reflect the new status
8. **User sees the change** when they check their appointment

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

```prisma
enum AppointmentStatus {
  PENDING
  APPROVED
  DECLINED
}

model Appointment {
  id        String            @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  date      String
  time      String
  reason    String
  status    AppointmentStatus @default(PENDING)
  createdAt DateTime          @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime          @updatedAt
  user      User              @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([status])
  @@map("appointments")
}
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Migrated and active in database

## üîß Server Actions (src/actions/appointments.ts)

All database operations are handled by server actions with:
- ‚úÖ Authentication checks (NextAuth session)
- ‚úÖ Authorization checks (admin-only actions)
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Cache revalidation (`revalidatePath`)
- ‚úÖ Type safety with TypeScript

### User Actions

#### `createAppointment(data)`
```typescript
// Creates a new appointment for the authenticated user
// Validates that user doesn't have existing pending/approved appointment
// Returns: AppointmentData
```

#### `getUserAppointment()`
```typescript
// Gets the most recent appointment for the authenticated user
// Returns: AppointmentData | null
```

#### `cancelAppointment()`
```typescript
// Deletes the user's most recent appointment
// Returns: void (throws on error)
```

### Admin Actions

#### `getAllAppointments()`
```typescript
// Gets all appointments with user details
// Restricted to: arcsmo19@gmail.com, ojasvikathuria777@gmail.com
// Returns: AppointmentData[]
```

#### `approveAppointment(appointmentId)`
```typescript
// Updates appointment status to APPROVED
// Restricted to admins
// Returns: AppointmentData
```

#### `declineAppointment(appointmentId)`
```typescript
// Updates appointment status to DECLINED
// Restricted to admins

```

#### `getAppointmentStats()`
```typescript
// Gets statistics: total, pending, approved, declined counts
// Restricted to admins
// Returns: { total, pending, approved, declined }
```
