# Related Products Feature

## Overview
The `relatedProducts` field has been successfully added to the Product model, enabling product recommendations and cross-selling opportunities.

## Schema Changes

### Product Model
Added two new fields to create a self-referential many-to-many relationship:
- `relatedProducts Product[] @relation("RelatedProducts")` - Products related to this product
- `relatedTo Product[] @relation("RelatedProducts")` - Products that list this product as related

## Database Migration
- Migration created: `20251012180741_add_related_products_relation`
- Creates a join table `_RelatedProducts` to manage the many-to-many relationship

3. **Recommend upgrades** - Optics suitable for the firearm type
4. **Cross-sell** - Safety gear and maintenance supplies for all firearms
5. **Show alternatives** - Similar models or variants within the same brand
6. **Bundle products** - Complete setups (firearm + ammo + accessories)
